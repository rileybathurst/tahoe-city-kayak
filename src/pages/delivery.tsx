          <h1>Delivery</h1>
          <p>Whether you need retail kayaks or paddleboards, or our rental watercraft, we can deliver throughout the Tahoe Region and beyond &#40;Sacramento and Reno areas included&#41;. We can deliver to your home, vacation property, or to public beaches &#40;where local rules and access allow&#41;.</p>

          <p>
            Since every delivery is different, a <a href={`tel:${strapiLocale.phone}`} rel="norel norefferer">phone call</a> or <a href={`mailto:${strapiLocale.email}`} rel="norel norefferer">email</a> is the best way to make a plan that meets your needs. Our delivery fees depend on how far we are traveling, how many employees we need to send, and how straightforward the delivery is &#40;ie. if we have to carry watercraft down flights of stairs, over rocks, etc&#41;. We aren't trying to make a profit from delivery fees, but we do need to cover our costs.
